  ### What is j.nome.s

  j.nome.s is a fast, simple, lightweight genome browser.
  It is built on top of [expressjs][expressjs] and [Node.JS][nodejs],
  and uses [MongoDB][mongodb] for storing the data.

  ### Why j.nome.s

  Current genome browsers include [GBrowse][gbrowse], the [UCSC genomebrowser][ucsc_browser]
  or [Jbrowse][jbrowse]. The main problem with those project, is that they
  heavily rely on [perl][perl] and [BioPerl][bioperl] scripts in order to both crunch data
  and render the output.
  Although [perl][perl] is widely used by bioinformaticians, it is a very inelegant
  language, very often leading to bloatware.
  Representing genomes is not an easy task considering the huge amout of data
  that has to be handled and shown in an intelligible way.

  j.nome.s aims to provide a simple genome browser environment, convenient to
  both the user, and the developer.
  It is based on [Node.JS][nodejs], which allowed to build a custom non
  IO-blocking server application. The data is stored in a 
  [MongoDB][mongodb] database, providing a scallable and
  efficient way to respectively store and access huge amount of data.

  ### Who

  j.nome.is is an ongoing project initiated by Alexis GRIMALDI and Avetis
  KAZARIAN.
